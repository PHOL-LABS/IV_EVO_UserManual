\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:introduction}

IV-Indicators Nano is a button-style gauge platform developed by PHOL-LABS Kft for Volkswagen Golf and Jetta Mk~II, Polo~86C, and Audi~80~B2 interiors. The series combines a compact retro look with firmware that can be tailored for voltage, pressure, temperature, lambda, or boost monitoring. Every indicator shares the same enclosure and USB programmer so that presets and firmware updates can be loaded without dismantling the dashboard.

The device is configured through an Android application or the IV-Conf web pack, allowing owners to change colour gradients, select bar or dot display modes, and calibrate the measurement range for their chosen sensor. This flexibility makes the gauge equally useful for preserving factory wiring or integrating modern engine upgrades.

This manual collates the official reference material originally released in HTML form. It guides you through safe handling, installation, configuration, and maintenance workflows while pointing out the known limitations of the beta Android app. Read the prohibitions in \autoref{ch:precautions} before connecting the programmer and refer to the configuration chapters whenever settings need to be restored or updated.
